  \section{Results}

  Our implementation produces the expected results on all input--output file pairs.

  The following table shows the closest pairs in some of the input files {\tt wc-instance-*.txt}.
  Here $n$ denotes the number of points in the input,
  and distance $\delta$.

  \bigskip\noindent
  \begin{tabular}{rr}\toprule
    $n$ & $\delta$ \\\midrule
    2 & 1.0 \\
    254 & 1.0 \\
    16382 & 1.0 \\
    65534 & 1.0 \\\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}


  \section{Implementation details}
  We have a global array of points called $points$ which contains all the points sorted by increasing $x$-value.

    Our running time is $O(n\log n)$ for $n$ points.

  \subsection{Walkthrough}
  
  We call the method \verb+ClosestPair+ which takes a $start$ and $end$ which are indexes into the $points$ array.
  
  The method examines the number of points that are in between $start$ and $end$.\newline

  If there are only 3 points then we compute the closest pair.\newline
  
  If there are 2 points then we simply say that the two points are the closest pair.\newline
  
  In any other case we compute the median $m$ and split $points$ into two smaller subsets:\newline

  $S_1 = [start..m]$\newline
  $S_2 = ]m..end]$\newline

  We then call \verb+ClosestPair+ recursively to get the smallest distance on the left side $d_{left}$ and on the right side $d_{right}$.

We then set the delta $\delta = min(d_{left}, d_{right})$.\newline

Using $\delta$ we compute the range around $m$ (in the range $m \pm \delta$) which might hold pairs that are closer than what we've found so far.
To help with this we compute upper bound and lower bounds between which we'll consider every pair.
